# CODE_OF_CONDUCT
None! We have no explicit code of conduct or rules because we are capable humans with emotional intelligence and trust in our collective ability to self-regulate. 

No rules doesn't mean chaos, rather it's a "trust first" stance that encourages collective responsibility and communication. 

This approach is a sophisticated form of community building where emotional intelligence flourishes precisely because it must, with no single interpretation for acceptable norms, fostering an environment where diverse viewpoints evolve through open discourse towards natural equilibrium.
